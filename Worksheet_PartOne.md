Part 1 â€“ Performance of Searching Routines
The following questions are taken from A laboratory Course in C++ Data Structures, by Roberge, Brandle and Whittington:

Step 2: Complete the following table by recording the Time per Search of the linearSearch(), binarySearch(), and unknownSearch() routines for each of the values of numKeys listed in the table.

| Routine | 1000| 2000  | 3000 | 4000 | 
| ---     | ----|----   | ---  | ---  |
| linearSearch() O(n) |   |   |   |   |
| binarySearch() O(logN) |  |   |  |   |
| unknownSearch() O()|     |   |   |   |

Step 3: Consider the two routines in the table above with known big O execution times. Which one should run faster? Describe the expected shape of the curve( straight or curved) for both algorithms.


Step 4: Using the code in the file search.h and your measured execution times as a basis, what is the execution time (Big O) of the unknownSearch() routine.  Briefly explain your reasoning behind this estimate.
